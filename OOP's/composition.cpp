/*Composition is a relationship between two classes where one class is composed of one or 
more instances of the other class. The composed class is typically an essential part of the 
composite class, and if the composite class is destroyed, the composed class will also be destroyed.

For example, a House class might be composed of a Room class, where the Room class cannot exist without the House class.*/
