S/////tatic Data Members/////
    Stacic data members are members which are common among all the objects, like if there 
    is a class called student, and there is a attribute called university name in student class
    the if we make the university name as static, then all the student objects will share the same 
    university name
    Static data members are class members that are declared using static keywords. 
    A static member has certain special characteristics which are as follows:

    ->Only one copy of that member is created for the entire class and is shared by all 
      the objects of that class, no matter how many objects are created.
    ->It is initialized before any object of this class is created, even before the main starts.
    ->It is visible only within the class, but its lifetime is the entire program.

    Static members are only declared in a class declaration, not defined. They must be 
    explicitly defined outside the class using the scope resolution operator.

/////Static Member Function in C++/////
    The static keyword is used with a variable to make the memory of the variable static once a static 
    variable is declared its memory canâ€™t be changed

    1) A static member function is independent of any object of the class. 
    2) A static member function can be called even if no objects of the class exist.
    3) A static member function can also be accessed using the class name through the scope resolution operator.
    4) A static member function can access static data members and static member functions inside or outside of the class.
    5) Static member functions have a scope inside the class and cannot access the current object pointer.
    6) You can also use a static member function to determine how many objects of the class have been created.

    The reason we need Static member function:
    Static members are frequently used to store information that is shared by all objects in a class. 
    For instance, you may keep track of the quantity of newly generated objects of a specific class type using 
    a static data member as a counter. This static data member can be increased each time an object is generated 
    to keep track of the overall number of objects.
