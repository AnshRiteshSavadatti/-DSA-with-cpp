Late binding, also known as dynamic binding, in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ 
refers to the process where the method that is going to be invoked is determined at runtime 
instead of compile-time. This is achieved through the use of virtual functions and pointers 
or references to base classes.

Key Concepts

Virtual Functions:
    A virtual function is a function that is declared within a base class and is meant to be 
    overridden in derived classes. It is declared using the keyword virtual.

Polymorphism:
    Late binding is closely associated with polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes 
    to be treated as objects of a common base class.

Vtable (Virtual Table):
    When a class has virtual functions, the compiler creates a vtable for the class. The vtable is 
    an array of pointers to the virtual functions of the class.

Each object of a class with virtual functions contains a pointer to the vtable (vptr). The vtable 
mechanism is used to resolve which function to call at runtime.
