/*Association is a relationship between two classes that defines a connection or a link between them. 
The association can be bi-directional, meaning that both classes can use each otherâ€™s methods and properties, 
or uni-directional, where only one class can use the methods and properties of the other. The relationship 
can be of any type, such as a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.

For example, a Customer class might be associated with an Order class, where each customer can have multiple orders.*/
