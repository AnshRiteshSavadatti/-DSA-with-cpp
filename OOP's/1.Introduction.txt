Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming 
aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming. 
The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that
no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

There are some basic concepts that act as the building blocks of OOPs i.e.

1. Class 
2. Objects
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction
5. Polymorphism
6. Inheritance
7. Dynamic Binding
8. Message Passing

Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism are knows are 4 pillars of OOPs


/////Class/////
The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. 
It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions,
which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. 
A class is like a blueprint for an object.


/////Object/////
An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behavior. 
An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is 
allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.




/////Encapsulation/////
In normal terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up data and information 
under a single unit. In Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined 
as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them. 


/////Abstraction/////
Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented 
programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.
Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the 
outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.

/////Polymorphism/////
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism 
as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A person at the same time
can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee.
So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
An operation may exhibit different behaviors in different instances. The behavior depends upon 
the types of data used in the operation. C++ supports operator overloading and function overloading.
