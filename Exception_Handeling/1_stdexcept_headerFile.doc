The `<stdexcept>` header in C++ typically includes several other standard headers indirectly. 
These headers are essential for exception handling and related functionality. Here are some of 
the headers that are indirectly included when you include `<stdexcept>`:

1. <exception>:
        This is the fundamental header for exceptions in C++. It defines the `std::exception` class 
        and other essential exception-related functionality.

2. <string>:
        This header provides the `std::string` class and related string manipulation functions. It's 
        often included indirectly because exceptions may involve string messages.

3. <cstdlib>: 
        This header provides functionality for general utilities, including `std::abort()` and `std::exit()`, 
        which can be related to exception handling in certain cases.

4. <stdexcept> itself: 
        It includes itself recursively, as it may define additional types, constants, or functions related 
        to the exception classes it provides (`std::logic_error`, `std::runtime_error`, etc.).

5. <stdexcept> also includes `<iosfwd>`, `<new>`, and `<typeinfo>`:
     These headers provide additional support for I/O, dynamic memory allocation, and type information, 
     respectively, which can be relevant in exception handling scenarios.

Keep in mind that the actual content included indirectly via `<stdexcept>` can vary depending on the C++ 
implementation and standard library version. However, these headers are commonly included because they are 
closely related to exception handling, error reporting, and managing exceptional situations in C++ 
programs.
